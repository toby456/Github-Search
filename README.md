Hi

I've developed this project using the React framework. Working with this framework is the axios library (to make HTTP request) and the moment library for date manipulation.

The GithubSearch component contains the bulk of this project but there is also three smaller components used to help display the data. These are RepoList, NoRepos and Repo. Apart from displaying the creation date and the star number of the search results I was able to achieve all the functionality set out in the task description.

To run this project you must save and unzip the file onto your computer. You must also have node package manager installed. Navigate to the projects main directory where you must then run the command:

 'npm install'

This will download and install all the necessary libraries to run the project. Once you have done this enter the command:

  'npm start'

The project will open automatically in your browser on a localhost address.

To use the application type in the language you want to search for into the search bar on the screen and then press submit. Within a couple of seconds the three repositories with the most stars from the past month will displayed. The title of the repositories act as a link to repo on the github website and the description for the repo is also displayed.

Due to time constraints very little presentation work has been carried out on this project and no tests have been written.

Thank-you for your time and I hope you enjoy my submission.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
